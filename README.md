# Ground Penetrating Radar Image Analysis for Underground Barrier Detection by Combining YOLOv12 with Channel-wise Attention and Denoising Auto-Encoder

## 1. Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Ground Penetrating Radar Image Analysis for Underground Barrier Detection by Combining YOLOv12 with Channel-wise Attention and Denoising Auto-Encoder".

The method integrates:

- YOLOv12: a SOTA real-time one-stage object detector

- Denoising Autoencoder: to suppress clutter and preserve hyperbolic GPR signatures

- CBAM: to highlight informative channel-spatial features

By combining denoising and attention mechanisms, the framework improves detection performance in challenging subsurface environments where GPR B-scan images suffer from noise, clutter, and overlappting reflections.
